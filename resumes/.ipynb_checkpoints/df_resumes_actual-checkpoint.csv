ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project
management roles. After spending my early career in the third sector, I moved
into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management
skills. In navigating the fast-paced, ambiguous and competitive world of AI, I
lead with a people-first approach to solve problems and help teams deliver
their
goals. Communication and stakeholder management are my real
strengths, both of which enable me to build trusted relationships with my
collaborators. I’m currently doing this within engineering at DeepMind, and
looking
for
opportunities where I can continue to apply my skills to
environments that bring together research and product development, making
AI applicable and accessible.

required. I adopt an agile approach to the setup and delivery of
projects, and strive to create inclusion and empowerment for all those
involved in the effort.
- Stakeholder management: As the point of contact for my projects, I
field information flows between the team and leadership. I take the
time to build my domain understanding so that I can act as a stand-in

ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project
management roles. After spending my early career in the third sector, I moved
into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management
skills. In navigating the fast-paced, ambiguous and competitive world of AI, I
lead with a people-first approach to solve problems and help teams deliver
their
goals. Communication and stakeholder management are my real
strengths, both of which enable me to build trusted relationships with my
collaborators. I’m currently doing this within engineering at DeepMind, and
looking
for
opportunities where I can continue to apply my skills to
environments that bring together research and product development, making
AI applicable and accessible.

April 2022 - Present
At Aleph Alpha, I focus on improving NLP models by means of new architectures
and pretraining paradigms. As a Senior Researcher, my role covers everything from
defining the research agenda of the projects I am part of to model training,
implementation and optimization. The projects I have worked on include large-scale
retrieval-augmented models, zero-shot generalization, and large-scale distributed
training to billions of parameters using standard techniques in model/data/pipeline
parallelism and HPC. Currently I am leading a team of researchers to build our next
frontier LLM, with a focus on model architecture & pretraining.
Microsoft - Azure Cognitive Services Research (CSR) Research SWE 2
April 2020 - March 2022
I worked on multilingual text and speech models as the foundation of Azure
Cognitive Services XYZ vision, to support various 1st and 3rd party Microsoft
services. I worked closely with researchers to innovate in this area and to bring
cutting-edge ideas into our models. My duties were to implement, train (fine-tune
and pretrain) and distill these models for various applications at Microsoft. Some of
our multilingual models were shipped on Azure offerings, such as Text Analytics,
Extractive Summarization, Language Understanding, and Machine Translation. I also
worked briefly on Knowledge Distillation Techniques for large models in Speech
Recognition. I was part of a core team developing an internal framework used by
researchers and data scientists for pretraining and fine-tuning these models
efficiently and at scale. Some of the public models that I have contributed to either
train or productionize via our internal framework, have appeared on Google’s
XTREME leaderboard, the WMT 2021 machine translation shared task (blog here),
and the Microsoft Research blog for training large-scale sparse multilingual models
for internal applications.
Microsoft - Cortana Digital Assistant - Software Engineer
October 2017 - April 2020, USA
I was in charge of the design, development and integration of a pipeline to collect
 user data tailored to improve Cortana’s natural language models while respecting
the compliance and user data agreements of Office 365. I was in charge of the
management of Cortana’s telemetry systems, this included the development of a
central logging library for microservice oriented architectures, and overseeing the
efficiency and performance of these systems. I worked as part of the Cortana
Infrastructure and Quality team developing common services and libraries for
Cortana. I worked on large scale (serving outlook customers) microservices built on

ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project
management roles. After spending my early career in the third sector, I moved
into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management
skills. In navigating the fast-paced, ambiguous and competitive world of AI, I

their
goals. Communication and stakeholder management are my real
strengths, both of which enable me to build trusted relationships with my
collaborators. I’m currently doing this within engineering at DeepMind, and

ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project
management roles. After spending my early career in the third sector, I moved
into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management
skills. In navigating the fast-paced, ambiguous and competitive world of AI, I

ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project

April 2022 - Present
At Aleph Alpha, I focus on improving NLP models by means of new architectures
and pretraining paradigms. As a Senior Researcher, my role covers everything from
defining the research agenda of the projects I am part of to model training,
implementation and optimization. The projects I have worked on include large-scale
retrieval-augmented models, zero-shot generalization, and large-scale distributed
training to billions of parameters using standard techniques in model/data/pipeline
parallelism and HPC. Currently I am leading a team of researchers to build our next
frontier LLM, with a focus on model architecture & pretraining.
Microsoft - Azure Cognitive Services Research (CSR) Research SWE 2
April 2020 - March 2022
I worked on multilingual text and speech models as the foundation of Azure
Cognitive Services XYZ vision, to support various 1st and 3rd party Microsoft
services. I worked closely with researchers to innovate in this area and to bring
cutting-edge ideas into our models. My duties were to implement, train (fine-tune
and pretrain) and distill these models for various applications at Microsoft. Some of
our multilingual models were shipped on Azure offerings, such as Text Analytics,
Extractive Summarization, Language Understanding, and Machine Translation. I also
worked briefly on Knowledge Distillation Techniques for large models in Speech
Recognition. I was part of a core team developing an internal framework used by
researchers and data scientists for pretraining and fine-tuning these models
efficiently and at scale. Some of the public models that I have contributed to either
train or productionize via our internal framework, have appeared on Google’s
XTREME leaderboard, the WMT 2021 machine translation shared task (blog here),
and the Microsoft Research blog for training large-scale sparse multilingual models
for internal applications.

ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project
management roles. After spending my early career in the third sector, I moved
into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management

into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management

their
goals. Communication and stakeholder management are my real
strengths, both of which enable me to build trusted relationships with my
collaborators. I’m currently doing this within engineering at DeepMind, and

ABOUT ME
People
person
with a demonstrated history of partnering and project
management roles. After spending my early career in the third sector, I moved
into tech where I’ve now spent four years growing my program management
skills. In navigating the fast-paced, ambiguous and competitive world of AI, I
lead with a people-first approach to solve problems and help teams deliver
their
goals. Communication and stakeholder management are my real
strengths, both of which enable me to build trusted relationships with my
collaborators. I’m currently doing this within engineering at DeepMind, and
looking
for

environments that bring together research and product development, making
AI applicable and accessible.
